Here's the privacy policy for your app, "Si O No?", emphasizing its no-data-collection approach and suitability for all ages:
Privacy Policy for Si O No?

Last Updated: June 4, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how we, the creators of Si O No?, handle information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
We Don't Collect Your Information

We want to make this crystal clear: Si O No? does not collect, store, or send us any personal information from its users.

This means we won't ask for, gather, or have access to anything that could identify you, such as your:

    Name
    Email address
    Phone number
    Location
    Device details
    How often you use the app
    Any other information that could be linked back to you.

The Si O No? app simply displays the words "yes," "no," and "maybe." This straightforward function doesn't require or involve any form of data collection.
No Permissions Needed

Since Si O No? doesn't need to access any personal information or features on your device, it doesn't require any special permissions on your phone. You won't see requests for access to your camera, microphone, contacts, photos, or location.
No Data Storage or Transmission

Everything Si O No? does happens right on your device. There's no server involved in receiving or processing any user data from the App. We don't send any information about your use of the App to ourselves or any third parties.
An App for Everyone

Si O No? is designed to be a simple, fun, and accessible tool for people of all ages. Because we don't collect any personal information from anyone, and the app's function is so basic, it's perfectly suitable for children to use. We're committed to protecting the privacy of all our users, and the principle of no data collection is at the heart of this App.
Changes to This Policy

We might update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we'll post the new version right here. We recommend checking this page periodically for any changes. Any updates to this Privacy Policy become effective the moment they're posted here.
